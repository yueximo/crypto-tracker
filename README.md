# Crypto Tracker

A simple crypto tracker I made utilizing the CoinGecko API. This is my first project using an API.

The user is given up-to-date info on almost all major cryptocurriences. The user is also able to search for a specific cryptocurrency that they want!

## This is what it looks like!
